# JavaScript Minecraft Command Library and a Minecraft Datapack Creator!

  Im writing this website and library to attempt to help efficiently make Minecraft datapacks in a more streamlined and organized because as it is very hard to keep track of everything going on when writing a datapack by and with no syntax hints or anything.
 
  This is an ongoing project, and is not ready for production use yet.
  
  This project uses JavaScript Libraries like JSzip, jQuery, Google's Blockly.js, ~~CodeMirror~~, Popper.js/Bootstrap, etc.
